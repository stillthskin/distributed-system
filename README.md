#P2P Client Server
This repository contains simple client-server scripts written in Python. The client script can send requests to the server and receive responses, while the server script listens for incoming requests and sends back responses.

##Prerequisites

    Python 3.x

##Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine.

##shell

$ git clone https://github.com/<username>/python-client-server-scripts.git

    Run the server script in a terminal window.

ruby

$ python server.py

    Run the client script in another terminal window.

ruby

$ python client.py

    Type a message in the client terminal window and press Enter. The message will be sent to the server, which will process it and send back a response.
